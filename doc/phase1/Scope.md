After having our first meeting, each of our team members decided to list down their learning goals for this project. The point of the task was to find out what type of technology each team member would want to work with so as to achieve their learning goals.

### Individual Member Learning Goals

**Cherise:** NoSQL, Travis, React

**Siyi:** Schema design, testing libraries

**Amrit:** React and Redux (if we do that)

**Vidya:** React, NoSQL, get more experience working with Node, maybe some Travis and testing

**Muskan:** Learn React, get more experience working with NoSQL

### Reaching Consensus

By looking at each member’s learning goals, it seemed that most of our team members had common goals in terms of what they wanted to achieve through this project. This put our team in a good position as it wouldn’t cause conflicts in terms of what we wanted to focus on as a group and what component of the project each one of us wanted to focus on individually. One of our team members had working experience with NoSQL databases, and a good portion of us were more than happy to put it in the necessary work to get familiarized with React. 

### Team Learning Goals

Taking all these factors into consideration, we came to the consensus that our common team learning goals were to learn NoSQL and React, with a few of us wishing to familiarize ourselves with Travis. It was clear that it made more sense for our team to focus on creating a well-organized and thorough database while also building a sophisticated and easy-to-use user interface for the service that we were planning to design.

### Phase 1 Use Case

The use case we decided to focus on first was the SDC Form Manager. We felt that focusing on adding, deleting and replacing an SDCForm —  the most fundamental part of the entire project — and having an entire vertical slice developed for it, would serve as a building block and aid us in our future phases, where we could build upon the progress we made here. Completing this use case would require us to figure out how to store SDCForm in our database in order to retrieve it with minimal hassle. In addition, it meant that the bare bones of the UI would need to be implemented so it could be fleshed out in greater detail in later phases. Both of these priorities tie in well with the aspects of the project we want to focus on the most.

### Future Use Cases & Priorities

Given our current priorities for the project, we felt that after having established a solid database that covered all our bases, making necessary modifications for implementing all of the use cases would be something we could manage. The UI would need to change accordingly to fulfill the necessary needs of the particular user, but we felt that we could complete that task too. Therefore, our team plans to hopefully complete all the use cases. Our next focus for the second phase in particular would be to tackle SDC Form Filler as well as SDC Form Receiver. The two use cases tie in well together and with phase 1’s project progress, we can expand on the SDCFormResponse portion of the database. In addition, the need to be able to fill out and search for forms allows us to improve upon the current UI design. After having successfully completed the other cases, we would turn our attention to the SDCTools (Service) Component which uses the groundwork we would’ve built so far and asks us to expand on it, something we definitely wish to do if time permits.
