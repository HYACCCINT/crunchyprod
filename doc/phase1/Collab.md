### Competencies, Constraints, and Collaboration
We are using Zenhub to manage our team and tasks. This is the link: https://github.com/csc302-fall-2020/proj-crunchycoders#zenhub and it is integrated into the repository. If you are not able to see it, you might need to install the [Zenhub Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd).

There’s a good balance of competencies between every member in the group. Most of the members are experienced with the node stack through courses or internships. We have individuals with specific expertises as well. One individual is good at SQL Databases, another has a great amount of experience with no-SQL databases, another has taken design courses, or done lots of work with CI/CD tools, etc. Most people have taken the same courses (Intro to Databases, Operating Systems, etc.) and some have finished their PEY terms. The schedules are somewhat conflicting. We used the website when2meet.com to pin down when everyone’s free during the week and only found Friday evenings to be the time when everyone is available.

### Availability
Due to the slim window when everyone is available, we have decided on Friday evenings as the time that we meet via a group call on Discord. Since the gap of a week is somewhat large, we also decided on a checkup using just text on Tuesdays on Discord. The meeting notes are being taken in discord channels specific for the phases of the project and a specific ‘notes’ channel. The TODO items are captured in the ‘general’ chat, and we use the messaging/emoji reactions feature of discord to record when we’re done each task in the list.

### Shared Documents
We are using Google Docs for editing the markdown files for P1. The link is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhsuefKHzCUl1nCpGPOcJVZA3LtlJbDlkY1n2G5U6JQ/edit?usp=sharing. 

### Methodology
We have not formalized our process as a type of Agile methodology, but generally we are developing individually for a week at a time with a meeting each week to catch up on each other’s progress. In the first meeting, we will be focusing on creating a common domain and schema and getting a shared understanding of the problem space. In following meetings, the focus will be on synchronizing the progress and making sure everything is being implemented end-to-end. We are splitting the workloads in terms of the domains (front end, back end, testing), making a common API and then making tasks in terms of the implementation pieces. We are using the tool Zenhub (integrated into Github), which is very similar to Trello or JIRA for tracking the specific tasks and changes each individual in the group is trying to make. 

### Work Division
We first created the list of learning goals for everyone in the group and will be dividing the work based on what people want to do. Siyi is the expert for couchDB and TravisCI in the group, and thus is responsible for creating the database and setting up Travis in the repo, Amrit has worked with document databases, end-to-end testing, and node/express in his PEY, etc. The individual learning goals are described in Scope.md and based on that, people are picking their tasks. The current roles are:
Amrit: Working on front-end components, Express endpoint implementation, and testing
Vidya and Siyi: Working on making database schema and functions that interact with it
Muskan and Cherise: Working on front-end components

### Communication
We are using Discord as our messaging and meeting platform. We are tracking our progress using Github issues for the overarching goals and Zenhub tasks for the granular issues.
